### Overview
This is a Image Editor website which is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But the main focus was the implementation of JavaScript.

This is a landing webpage, fully responsive to all screen sizes, which lands you directly to image editor interface, where you can edit any image. 

### The challenge
a. Choose an image from the local machine and put it on the image editor to edit.

b. Syncing the filter buttons with the image and slider, so that at a time, when definig the value of filter property it affect the visuals of the image all together.

c. Reseting all the selected filters, when Reset button is clicked.

d. Downloading the image as it as with all the selected filters applied.

### Project description
I chose this project because it needs strong implementation knowledge of DOM, callbacks,  different events and methods, and most importantly good logic building skills. 


It includes filter buttons and a slider assigned to each button using which, one can set a particular filter as required.

It also includes rotate and flip buttons using which, one can rotate or flip the image.

It is provided with one reset filter button using which, one can reset all the filters selected by user.

It includes one save image button using which, one can download the image after applying the filters.

The landing page of the website is made using HTML & CSS. CSS flexbox property has been used all over, to make the layout of the page. 

MediaQuery is used to make the website responsive to all the screen sizes.

JavaScript has been used to make all the functionalities one can see in this website.

This website has been hosted on netlify, which is again a good and recommended platform to host any website for free.

### What I learned
I learned diffrent events like , 'change', 'input', 'load' etc., and their different usecases. I took reference of 'developer.mozilla.org' to learn the working of these events and their different usecases.

I learned applying event listeners to different buttons or elements and get the desired results.

I learned use of 'canvas' element of HTML, which, i used in this project to draw the image same as the user edited.

I learned the 'download' property of <a> tag, which i used to download the image drawn by canvas element's drawImage property.


### Continued development

- There were numerous events and methods of javaScript, which i came across during this project.
and i am surely, going to look into that, and if possible, will use in my future project related to js.
